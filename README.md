### What is the main purpose ?

The main purpose of this game is to teach children to not share their personal information on the internet.

This is achieved by creating fictional world with fictional animals.

After completing the quest each animal will ask the player one personalized question. like

- Where do you live ?
- What is your name ?
- etc

Subsequently the player will have the choice to either ***answer or not to answer the question*** 

If the player choose to ***answer*** the quest will end. However if the player choose ***not to answer*** he/she will be given the same choice again then if the player answers no again the quest will stop.

### Ending

The game will contain two endings

#### 1st ending (bad)

This ending will occur as soon as the player will finish the last quest and gave at least 1 personal data

The game will prompt the player to go back to his house however as soon as the player enters his/hers house the game will "crash" and the screen with player's information will pop up as well as the text that will say something like "You have been hacked". 

The main purpose of this ending is to scare the child a bit in order for it to remember that the personal information is very valuable and therefore should not be given to random people on the internet


#### 2nd ending (good)

This ending will occur as soon as the player will finish the last quest and gave no personal data
